# Migrations #

# A common question is: “why aren’t we ignoring migrations?”.
# Wouldn’t it make sense to create the migrations on the server and then migrate them right away?
# Yes, in some cases that would make sense, but there is a big issue with that.
# You will always want to have the same migrations on your development machine as on the server.
# Imagine this: you want a field to be False for every record.
# You create a new field with default=False, in this case all fields are fields.
# Then you decide to change the field and change the default to True.
# The current fields are still marked as False since you ran that migration first.
# If you wouldn’t commit the migration files, all fields would be True since the production server wouldn’t know
# that it was False previously.

# Next to that, Django recommends including migration files as they are part of the code base:
# The migration files for each app live in a “migrations” directory inside of that app,
# and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part of, its codebase.
# You should be making them once on your development machine and then running the same migrations on your colleagues’
# machines, your staging machines, and eventually your production machines.

.pyc files

# Python will always compile your code to byte code.
# This is saved in the .pyc files. You can’t do much with that and we don’t need it, python will create them anyway.
# It’s best to just ignore them through .gitignore.
